* The objective of this study is to train the model to be able to predict the input images and classify it into one of the
garbage recycling categories, which includes cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, trash.
* The CNN generated an accuracy score of 92.96% which proved that this model has a potential to be used  a a tool for 
predicting garbage clases.
* Databaset includes cardboard(393), glass(491), metal(400), paper(584), plastic(472), trash(127)
